The source code is licensed under the GPLv3. If you download the source or create builds you must comply with that license.

#### Things you can't do with this source

- Do not use the name "Vital", "Vital Audio", "Tytel" or "Matt Tytel" for marketing or to name any distribution of binaries built with this source. This source code does not give you rights to infringe on trademarks.
- Do not connect to any web service at https://vital.audio, https://account.vital.audio or https://store.vital.audio from your own builds. This is against the terms of using those sites.
- Do not distribute the presets that come with the free version of Vital. They're under a separate license that does not allow redistribution.
