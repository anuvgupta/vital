## Common prompts for development steering

## Steering document update

For preventing issues from reoccuring:

```
Nice, that absolutely fixed it! Please summarize the key learnings from the coding task, the error we faced, the solution that actually worked, and the important takeaways and key learnings about the codebase's structure/design that will help to avoid this issue in future - re: best practices. Add these to the steering document in the "Key Learnings and Common Issues" section under a new bullet point. Be concrete and descriptive, including exact file names, class names, error names, to ensure we don't make this mistake again (this should be one bullet point but you should add sub-bullet-points to add more detail).
Try to limit to 1000 characters so steering doc doesn't get too long over time - but if you need more, ask me.
Steering document is `vital/steering.md`.
```


For mapping the codebase:

```
Please add any of the key files we explored, edited, or created to the "Key Files Reference" section of the steering document. Be concrete and descriptive of what the file is used for in the codebase and what core functionality it contains.
Don't be overly verbose, try to limit to 1 sentence description per file, usually under 10 words, max 15 words.
Steering document is `vital/steering.md`.
```
